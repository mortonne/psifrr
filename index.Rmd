Analysis and visualization of free recall data.

psifrr relies on the [Psifr](https://psifr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) Python package, which is called from R using the `reticulate` package.

## Installation

First, install `remotes`:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
```

Next, install psifrr with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("mortonne/psifrr")
```

## Working with free recall data

To load a sample dataset in [Psifr format](https://psifr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/import.html):

```{r}
library(psifrr)
raw <- sample_data("Morton2013")
head(raw)
```

To analyze a dataset, we need to first score it by matching up study items to recalled items.
See [Scoring data](https://psifr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/score.html) for details.

```{r}
data <- merge_free_recall(raw, study_keys = list("category"))
```

We can use `filter_data` to a select one list for a sample of what the results look like:

```{r}
filter_data(data, subjects = 1, lists = 1)
```

See [Managing data](https://mortonne.github.io/psifrr/reference/index.html#managing-data)
for a full list of functions that operate on free recall data.

## Recall performance

### Serial position curve

We can calculate average recall for each serial position using `spc`.

```{r}
recall <- spc(data)
head(recall)
```

Next, we can calculate statistics for each serial position using `boot_ci`.
We'll take the `recall` statistic, group by `input` position, and calculate the
mean and 95% bootstrap confidence interval for each position.

```{r}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(magrittr)
stats <- recall %>%
  group_by(input) %>% 
  summarise(boot_ci(recall), .groups = "drop")
head(stats)
```

We can then plot the serial position curve with a confidence band using `ggplot2`.

```{r, spc}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(stats, aes(x = input)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", aes(y = mean)) +
  geom_ribbon(alpha = 0.1, fill = "blue", aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper)) +
  ylim(0, 1) +
  labs(x = "Serial position", y = "Recall probability") +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

### Probability of Nth recall

We can also split up recalls, to test for example how likely participants were to initiate recall with the last item on the list, using `pnr`.

```{r}
nth_recall <- pnr(data)
head(nth_recall)
```

This gives us the probability of recall conditional on both output position (`output`) and serial or input position (`input`).

### Prior-list intrusions

Participants will sometimes accidentally recall items from prior lists; these recalls are known as prior-list intrusions (PLIs). To better understand how prior-list intrusions are happening, you can look at how many lists back those items were originally presented using `pli_list_lag`.

First, you need to choose a maximum list lag that you will consider. This determines which lists will be included in the analysis. For example, if you have a maximum lag of 3, then the first 3 lists will be excluded from the analysis. This ensures that each included list can potentially have intrusions of each possible list lag.

```{r}
pli <- pli_list_lag(data, max_lag = 3)
head(pli)
```

The analysis returns a raw count of intrusions at each lag (`count`), the count divided by the number of included lists (`per_list`), and the probability of a given intrusion coming from a given lag (`prob`).

## Temporal clustering

### Lag conditional response probability

In all CRP analyses, transition probabilities are calculated conditional on a given transition being available. For example, in a six-item list, if the items 6, 1, and 4 have been recalled, then possible items that could have been recalled next are 2, 3, or 5; therefore, possible lags at that point in the recall sequence are -2, -1, or +1. The number of actual transitions observed for each lag is divided by the number of times that lag was possible, to obtain the CRP for each lag.

```{r}
crp <- lag_crp(data)
head(crp)
```

The results show the count of times a given transition actually happened in the observed recall sequences (`actual`) and the number of times a transition could have occurred (`possible`). Finally, the `prob` column gives the estimated probability of a given transition occurring, calculated by dividing the actual count by the possible count.

### Compound lag conditional response probability

The compound lag-CRP was developed to measure how temporal clustering changes as a result of prior clustering during recall. They found evidence that temporal clustering is greater immediately after transitions with short lags compared to long lags. The `lag_crp_compound` analysis calculates conditional response probability by lag, but with the additional condition of the lag of the previous transition.

```{r}
compound_crp <- lag_crp_compound(data)
head(compound_crp)
```

The results show conditional response probabilities as in the standard lag-CRP analysis, but with two lag columns: `previous` (the lag of the prior transition) and `current` (the lag of the current transition).

### Lag rank

We can summarize the tendency to group together nearby items by running a lag rank analysis using `lag_rank`. For each recall, this determines the absolute lag of all remaining items available for recall and then calculates their percentile rank. Then the rank of the actual transition made is taken, scaled to vary between 0 (furthest item chosen) and 1 (nearest item chosen). Chance clustering will be 0.5; clustering above that value is evidence of a temporal contiguity effect.

```{r}
ranks <- lag_rank(data)
head(ranks)
```

## Category clustering

### Category conditional response probability

If there are multiple categories or conditions of trials in a list, we can test whether participants tend to successively recall items from the same category. The category-CRP, calculated using `category_crp`, estimates the probability of successively recalling two items from the same category.

```{r}
cat_crp <- category_crp(data, "category")
head(cat_crp)
```

### Category clustering measures

A number of measures have been developed to measure category clustering relative to that expected due to chance, under certain assumptions. Two such measures are list-based clustering (LBC) and adjusted ratio of clustering (ARC). These measures can be calculated using the `category_clustering` function.

```{r}
clust = category_clustering(data, "category")
head(clust)
```

Both measures are defined such that positive values indicate above-chance clustering. ARC scores have a maximum of 1, while the upper bound of LBC scores depends on the number of categories and the number of items per category in the study list.

## Semantic clustering

### Distance conditional response probability

Models of semantic knowledge allow the semantic distance between pairs of items to be quantified. If you have such a model defined for your stimulus pool, you can use the distance CRP analysis to examine how semantic distance affects recall transitions.

You must first define distances between pairs of items. Here, we use correlation distances based on the wiki2USE model.

```{r}
d <- sample_distances("Morton2013")
```

We also need a column indicating the index of each item in the distances matrix. We use `pool_index` to create a new column called `item_index` with the index of each item in the pool corresponding to the distances matrix.

```{r}
data$item_index <- pool_index(data$item, d$items)
```

Finally, we must define distance bins. Here, we use 10 bins with equally spaced distance percentiles. Note that, when calculating distance percentiles, we use the `squareform` function to get only the non-diagonal entries.

```{r}
percentiles <- pracma::linspace(.01, .99, 10)
edges <- quantile(pracma::squareform(d$distances), percentiles)
```

We can now calculate conditional response probability as a function of distance bin using `distance_crp`, to examine how response probability varies with semantic distance.

```{r}
dist_crp <- distance_crp(data, "item_index", d$distances, edges)
head(dist_crp)
```

### Distance rank

Similarly to the lag rank analysis of temporal clustering, we can summarize distance-based clustering (such as semantic clustering) with a single rank measure. The distance rank varies from 0 (the most-distant item is always recalled) to 1 (the closest item is always recalled), with chance clustering corresponding to 0.5. Given a matrix of item distances, we can calculate distance rank using `distance_rank`.

```{r}
ranks <- distance_rank(data, "item_index", d$distances)
head(ranks)
```

### Distance rank shifted

Like with the compound lag-CRP, we can also examine how recalls before the just-previous one may predict subsequent recalls. To examine whether distances relative to earlier items are predictive of the next recall, we can use a shifted distance rank analysis using `distance_rank_shifted`.

Here, to account for the category structure of the list, we will only include within-category transitions.

```{r}
ranks <- distance_rank_shifted(data, "item_index", d$distances, 4, test_key = "category", test = function(x, y) x == y)
head(ranks)
```

The distance rank is returned for each shift. The -1 shift is the same as the standard distance rank analysis.
