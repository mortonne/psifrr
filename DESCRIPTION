Description: Psifr has tools to visualize recall sequences, to make it easier 
    to see general trends in the data. Psifr also provides targeted analyses 
    to examine factors that may affect recall, such as recency, primacy, 
    temporal contiguity, stimulus category, and semantic relatedness. Analyses 
    are customizable, allowing flexible filtering of included data to help 
    answer precise questions. Extensive automated testing is used to ensure 
    the consistency and correctness of analysis results.
