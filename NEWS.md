# psifrr 0.3.0

* Support for calculating bootstrap confidence intervals has been added.
* The documentation now contains examples of plotting curves with confidence bands and splitting analyses by condition.

# psifrr 0.2.0

* All non-plotting functions from Psifr now have R interfaces, documentation, and examples.
* Documentation with expanations of all analyses has been added to the [psifrr](https://mortonne.github.io/psifrr/index.html) website.
* A function reference page has also been added to the website.
* Citation information has been added to the website and the README file.
* Installation has been streamlined using `reticulate` configuration.

Operation of the `psifrr` package currently still depends on the `reticulate` branch of Psifr on Github. A future release of Psifr will allow a `psifrr`-compliant version to be installed from PyPI.
